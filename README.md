### Current status

As of this posting most of the code has been written, however there were a few challanges along the way which I will still need to troubleshoot:
1 - MySQL errors when trying to execute the schema.sql file preventing me to validate the server connection.  
2 - Heroku deployment of working code.  Without working code, it's challenging to deploy to Heroku
